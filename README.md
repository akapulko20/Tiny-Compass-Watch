# Tiny-Compass-Watch
An electronic watch that makes hard to get lost

The Tiny Compass Watch is an extended version of the [Mega Tiny Time Watch](https://github.com/technoblogy/mega-tiny-time-watch/) project created by [David Johnson-Davies](https://github.com/technoblogy). In order to obtain a compass functionality, just three additional components have been used: MPU-9250 (TDK InvenSense), 0.1uF capacitor and a push button. A minimal modifications of the original circuit have been made: push button connected to the PA1 line, MPU-9250 chip connected to the ATtiny814 via Two Wire Interface (INT output of the MPU-9250 connected to the PA7 line).
