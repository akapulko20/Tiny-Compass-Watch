# Tiny-Compass-Watch
*An electronic watch that makes hard to get lost*

The Tiny Compass Watch is an extended version of the [Mega Tiny Time Watch](https://github.com/technoblogy/mega-tiny-time-watch/) project created by [David Johnson-Davies](https://github.com/technoblogy). In order to obtain a compass functionality, just three additional components have been used: MPU-9250 (TDK InvenSense), 0.1uF capacitor and a push button. A minimal modifications of the original circuit have been made: push button connected to the PA1 line, MPU-9250 chip connected to the ATtiny814 via Two Wire Interface (INT output of the MPU-9250 connected to PA7 pin just for a possible future improvements).

  The [MPU-9250](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/9-axis/mpu-9250/) is a System in Package (SiP) that combines two chips: the MPU-6500, which contains a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, and the AK8963, the market leading 3-axis digital compass.
  <p>[TinyMegaI2C Library](https://github.com/technoblogy/tiny-mega-i2c) by David Johnson-Davies has been chosen for communication with MPU-9250, however *TinyMegaI2C.read()* function replaced, as was discussed [here](https://github.com/technoblogy/tiny-mega-i2c/issues/3). The corresponding function proposed by [buckket](https://gist.github.com/buckket/09619e6cdc5dee056d41bfb57065db81) has been used.
